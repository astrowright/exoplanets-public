<font size=+1>The histogram of masses (Msini) for
all known companions to&nbsp; Main Sequence stars (FGKM type), within the
mass range 0 - 15 Jupiter masses. The most massive companions are easiest
to detect and virtually no companions are missed 
above 10 Jupiter masses, if they
orbit within 3 AU.  Approximately 1000 stars are represented in this survey
which is a nearly complete study of FGK main sequence stars in the Hipparcos
catalog of stars.

<p>
Apparently, the number of companions begins to rise at 8 Jupiter masses,
and continues to rise toward the lowest detectable masses, ~0.3 Jupiters,
where detectabiliy becomes poor.</font></b></blockquote>

<p>
At most 1% of stars harbor brown-dwarf companions within several
AU. Their masses are spread out from 10 - 70 Mjup, as demonstrated beautifully
by the data of Michel Mayor, Antoine Duquennoy, and Didier Queloz at Geneva
Observatory and Observatoire de Haute Provence.

<b><a href="ecc.html">ORBITAL
ECCENTRICITIES</a></b></h2>

That our Solar System has its largest planet, Jupiter, in a circular orbit
promotes the stability of circular orbits among the other 8 planets. If
our Jupiter were in an eccentric orbit, the Earth and Mars would likely
be gravitationally scattered out of the Solar System. Thus our existence,
and the existence of life in the habitable zone, depends on both Jupiter
and Earth being in mutually stable, circular orbits. It is probably no
accident that our Solar System contains circular orbits.
<p>Eccentric orbits may occur relatively commonly for extrasolar planets.
Just one eccentric giant planet orbiting a star can spell dynamical doom
for terrestrial planets, and may bode ill for slowly evolving creatures.
The claim that all planetary orbits must be like ours may well be a circular
argument.
