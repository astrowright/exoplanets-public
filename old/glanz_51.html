Far-Off Planet Makes a Comeback</H2> <STRONG>James Glanz</STRONG><P>
<STRONG>"I</STRONG>t looks like we're back to an ugly old
planet,&quot; says David Gray. Nearly a year ago, the University of
Western Ontario astronomer had issued a serious challenge to the case
for an extrasolar planet--the first to be discovered around a sunlike
star. He presented evidence that slow jitters in the spectrum of the
parent star, thought to result from a planet's periodic tug, were
actually due to a pulsation of the star's gases (<EM>Nature</EM>, 27
February 1997). The ensuing debate was at times less than civil. But
harmony has been restored: Gray and at least three other groups say
they have been unable to reproduce his earlier results. What looked
like a planet killer may have been just a chance alignment of noisy
data points.<P> 

One group, led by Artie Hatzes of
the University of Texas, Austin, published its results in yesterday's
issue of <EM>Nature </EM>alongside Gray's concession. A paper by
another group, led by Timothy Brown at the High Altitude Observatory
in Boulder, Colorado, has been accepted at <EM>Astrophysical Journal
Letters</EM>. And a third group, at the University of Paris, is still
finishing its analysis but also sees &quot;no indication&quot; of
pulsations of the star, 51 Pegasi, says team member Jean
Schneider. &quot;The only reasonable explanation for the velocity
wobble is [still] a planet,&quot; concludes Didier Queloz, who made
the discovery with Michel Mayor at the Geneva Observatory
(<EM>Science</EM>, 20 October 1995, p.375).<P> Mayor and Queloz,
who is now at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California,
had monitored hundreds of dark absorption spikes carved into 51 Peg's
spectrum by elements in the star's atmosphere such as iron and
calcium, which filter out specific frequencies of light. In light from
a stationary star, the frequencies would remain fixed. But the
observed frequencies shifted up and down by small amounts over a
4.23-day period. Mayor and Queloz inferred that a roughly Jupiter-size
planet was whipping around 51 Peg in an orbit much closer than
Mercury's around the sun, causing the entire star to wobble and
shifting the spike frequencies by the Doppler or train-whistle
effect.<P> Then came Gray's challenge. Using a spectrograph most
astronomers describe as somewhat outmoded, he monitored a single
absorption spike and found that asymmetries in its shape also changed
over a 4.23-day period. A simple Doppler shift couldn't cause the
distortion, but Gray believed that both the shape changes and the
frequency shifts could be due to a bizarre type of
&quot;nonradial&quot; oscillation never seen in a sunlike star: a slow
sloshing of the star's surface gases. Because his 39 noisy data points
were scattered over 7 years, however, Gray and others now emphasize
that there was roughly a one-in-300 chance that a spurious 4.23-day
signal might show up by chance.<P> That appears to be what
happened. &quot;I have to conclude that nature played a dirty trick on
him,&quot; says Brown. In the most conclusive of the new measurements,
Hatzes and co-workers made about 120 measurements of several
absorption lines at more than twice Gray's spectral resolution and saw
no changes in the line shapes. Neither did Gray when he made further
observations with his original apparatus. His earlier results, he
says, were either a fluke or a transient phenomenon that has since
stopped.<P> But as the technical disagreement fades, the dispute has
thrown light on the underside of a high-stakes field where new claims
are followed like sports scores by the wider public. Astronomers
grumbled privately about the attacks on Gray's work that appeared on
an elaborate
<a href=http://exoplanets.org/science.html TARGET=_top>Web site</a>
--complete with links to corporate
sponsors--maintained by the planet searcher Geoff Marcy of San
Francisco State University. Gray responded in kind on his own Web
site, calling some objections &quot;arguments of ignorance.&quot;
Tempers have since cooled, but Hatzes says: &quot;I didn't like to see
that. It should have been a more civilized debate.&quot;<P>
