Face-on Orbits?</font></font></b></center>

<h4>
<multicol cols=1>It has been suggested that most extrasolar planets reside
in nearly face-on orbits. If so, they are much more massive, making most
of them brown dwarfs or stars, rather than planets. This suggestion was
articulated in 1996 about 51 Pegasi and 55 Cancri:</h4>
<b><i>``Thus we could conceivably be viewing this system's orbital plane
at a wide angle. If so, 51 Peg B's mass could well be 10 times greater
than the 0.6-Jupiter lower limit. The jury is still out, but at this time
I would bet on 51 Pegasi B being a brown dwarf, not a member of a planetary
system. (And, as the table above shows, similar considerations apply to
Rho1 Cancri B, an M sin i = 0.9 Jupiter object with a 15-day "year" that
Marcy and Butler disclosed in April.)''</i></b>

<b><font color="#000099">Seven Arguments Against Face-On Orbits</font></b></h1></center>
<b>There are many ways to show that face-on orbits cannot explain the extrasolar
planets. Here are seven of them.</b>
<p><b><font color="#CC0000">1. There is no way to bias star selection toward
extreme face-on orbits, especially for unseen companions. </font>The target
stars are located all over the sky, and they are selected with no prior
knowledge about the existence of any low-mass companions. Thus no information
about orbital inclinations exists. Stellar and brown dwarf companions reside
in randomly oriented orbits.</b>
<p><b><font color="#CC0000">2. There are too few orbiting brown dwarfs
and stars from which to draw the face-on orbits.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>Suppose
hypothetically that a selection bias <i>does</i> exist that favors face-on
orbits. How many brown dwarf companions, <i>N</i>, must reside in a reservoir,
from which 25 face-on orbits could be drawn, to masquerade as planets?</b>
<p><b>To fix ideas, suppose that the <i>N</i> brown dwarfs have a typical 
mass of, M = 45 Mjup&nbsp;&nbsp; (Jupiter-masses), and
suppose that 25 of them exhibit&nbsp;&nbsp; Msin(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 Mjup &nbsp;&nbsp; (faking as planets because of their
nearly face-on orbits). &nbsp; The orbits of the 25 "fake-planets" 
must be face-on
within an angle:&nbsp; i &lt; 2.5 deg&nbsp; (sin<i>i</i> &lt; 2/45). The
fraction of orbits that are face-on within 2.5 deg is:</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fraction&nbsp;&nbsp;
=&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 - cos(2.5 deg)&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp; /&nbsp;
1000</b>
<p><b>Thus, the brown dwarf reservoir from which the "fake planets" were drawn
must contain:</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>N</i>&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp;
25 * 1000&nbsp; =&nbsp; 25000&nbsp;&nbsp; brown dwarf companions.</b>
<p><b><font color="#007799">Conclusion:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If 25
extrasolar planets are merely brown dwarfs in face-on orbits,&nbsp;&nbsp; a reservoir
of 25000 brown dwarf companions must exist somewhere, out of which the
face-on orbits were selected.</b>
<p><b>This conclusion is not plausible, as less than 10 brown dwarf companions
are known, not the required 25000. The required reservoir of 25000 brown
dwarf companions does not exist from which the 25 face-on orbits could
be drawn. Even a purposeful selection of face-on orbits cannot explain
the planets, by a factor of over 1000.</b>
<p><b><font color="#007799">Corollary:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is further
implausible that stellar companions in face-on orbits
could serve as the explanation for the "planets". A reservoir of&nbsp;&nbsp; 125000
orbiting M dwarf companions&nbsp;&nbsp; (M = 0.1 solar-mass) is required
in order to yield 25 face-on orbits having&nbsp;&nbsp; Msin<i>i</i> &lt;
2 Mjup. No catalog of 125000 M dwarf companions exists. Even if such a
catalog of binaries existed, we would still need a way to select orbits
that were face-on within 1 degree, for which the probability is&nbsp;&nbsp;
0.0002&nbsp; .</b>
<p><b><font color="#CC0000">3. No "selection effect" is possible: the target
stars include of all solar-type stars within 30 pc.
</font>All main sequence
stars having spectral type G and K, and brighter than magnitude V=7.5 (some
1000 stars), are included in our planet search. (We only exclude known
binary stars with separations less than 2 arcsec, to avoid light from two
stars entering the spectrometer slit). Thus for such a nearly complete
sample of target stars, it is impossible for the orbital inclinations to
be extremely face-on (or even systematically face-on).</b>
<p><b><font color="#CC0000">4. The <a href="http://exoplanets.org/masshist.gif">histogram
of Msin<i>i</i></a> is peaked at below 1 Jupiter mass.</font>This peak
at low masses can only occur if the true mass distribution is peaked similarly
at below 1 Jupiter mass. Doppler techniques easily detect the more massive
companions, Msin<i>i</i> = 10-80 Mjup. Despite this ease of detection,
all Doppler surveys show that such massive companions are rare.</b>
<p><b>If companions of 10-100 Jupiter masses (brown dwarfs) were common,
we would easily detect them with their randomly oriented orbital inclinations.
But such values of Msin<i>i</i> (10-100 jupiters) simply are rarely found
in Doppler surveys. Instead, the distribution of Msin<i>i</i> is peaked
below 1 Jupiter mass, with a dearth of Msin<i>i</i> between 10-100 Jupiter
masses.</b>
<p><b><font color="#660000">5. </font><font color="#CC0000">The transiting
planet orbiting
<a href="http://astron.berkeley.edu/~gmarcy/transit.htm">HD209458</a>,
definitely resides in an edge-on orbit, not face-on.</font> Its mass is
also known unambiguously: M = 0.63 Jupiter masses. The occurrence of one
transiting planet among the 10 known close-in jupiters is consistent with
the hypothesis that the orbits are randomly oriented. If the orbits were
preferentially face-on, the probability of finding a transiting planet
would be small.</b>
<p><b><font color="#CC0000">6. If the companions were stars instead of
planets we could detect the infrared luminosity from them, </font>both
as IR excess luminosity and as resolved point sources with adaptive optics.
However, while most of the 50 extrasolar planets have been carefully examined
with adaptive optics in the infrared, none has revealed a stellar companion.</b>
<p><b><font color="#CC0000">7. Astrometry from the Hipparcos satellite
can just barely reveal angular wobbles of 2 milliarcse</font><font color="#660000">c</font>
(2 sigma). Such detectable wobbles would occur for the following benchmark
case:&nbsp;&nbsp; a companion of 40 Jupiter masses, orbiting at 1 AU around
a target star that is 20 pc away.</b>
<p><b>The Hipparcos research team has spent 8 years studying the subtle
nature of the uncertainties from Hipparcos measurements They have examined
the Hipparcos astrometry of planet-bearing stars and found no such wobbles,
i.e., <a href="http://exoplanets.org/perryman.html" target="_top">(Perryman
et al. 1996)</a>. The lack of astrometric wobbles provides secure upper
limits of 40 Jupiter masses for planets orbiting at least 1 AU from a typical
star surveyed.&nbsp;</b>

<b><font color="#3366FF">51 Pegasi: Counter Argument to Face-On Orbit</font></b></h1></center>
<b>If 51 Peg b indeed has a mass ``10 times greater'' than its lower limit
of 0.46-Jupiter, then it would have a mass of 4.6 times that of Jupiter.
Such a modest increase over Jupiter's mass does not imply status as a brown
dwarf.</b>
<p><b>The probability that the orbital plane is inclined so much that its
mass is greater than 4.6-Jupiter is 0.5%.</b>
<p><b>51 Peg b could have a mass of, say, 45 Jupiter masses, making it
truly a brown dwarf. However, the probability that 51 Peg B has over 45
Jupiter masses
<a href="http://exoplanets.org/mdwarf.html" target="_top">(i.e.,
an extreme orbital inclination) </a>is less than 1 in 10,000.</b>
<br><b>Moreover, if 51 Peg's companion were as massive as, say, 45 Jupiter
masses, the companion would tidally spin up the star. This is clearly not
the case, because 51 Peg is a chromospherically quiet stars and has low
coronal xrays. <a href="http://exoplanets.org/mdwarf.html" target="_top">51
Peg is not spinning rapidly and therefore its companion is not a massive
brown dwarf (Pravdo et al. 1996).</a></b>
<p><b>Clearly, the probability that most of the orbits of the 50 extrasolar
planets are viewed nearly face-on is negligible. <i>Indeed, there is a
bias toward detecting orbits that are nearly edge-on, because the Doppler
variations are greater for such orientations.</i></b>
<p><b>In general, the extrasolar planets must have masses predominantly
under a few Jupiter-masses. The
<a href="http://exoplanets.org/masshist.gif">histogram
of Msin<i>i</i></a> rises steeply toward the lowest detectable masses.
This rise can only occur if most of the companions have masses near or
below that of Jupiter, rather than 10x the mass of Jupiter. All biases
favor the detection of the high--mass companions. Such massive companions
(50 Mjup) are rare compared to the Jupiter-mass planets.</b>
