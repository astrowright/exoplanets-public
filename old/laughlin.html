     We show that Jovian planets will frequently experience orbital
disruption due to interactions with binary stars in their birth
clusters. We attack the problem using a Monte Carlo approach and
estimate the effective cross section for severe orbital disruption:
sigma=230^2 AU. Combining the numerically determined cross section
with typical cluster densities n and velocity dispersions v, we find a
typical interaction rate of Gamma = n sigma v = 0.13 disruptive
encounters per star per 100 million years.

This scattering mechanism naturally accounts for
extrasolar systems such as 14 Her or 16 Cyg B, in which a Jovian
planet is found in an eccentric and reasonably close orbit. This
mechanism can also produce systems with extremely small orbits, such
as 51 Peg.  However, the efficiency is too low to account for the
observed frequency of such close systems, and hence some other
mechanism for orbital migration is almost certainly at work. Because
of mass segregation within the birth cluster, we predict that higher
mass stars will have a larger fraction of planets with eccentric
orbits than the low-mass stars that comprise the bulk of the stellar
population.
