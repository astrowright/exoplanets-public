<tr><td>
Just over a year ago, Dr Michel Mayor and Dr Didier Queloz of the Geneva Observatory in 
Switzerland announced the possible discovery of the first planet around a Sun-like star called 
51 Pegasi. The evidence was based on observations showing that the star was wobbling 
systematically in space, in just the way that it should if it were orbited by a large planet about 
half the mass of Jupiter, by far the largest planet in our own Solar System. 
</td></tr>
</table>
<table width="460">
<tr><td>
In our own Solar System, giant planets such as Jupiter and Saturn orbit at distances relatively 
far away from the Sun. Hence the next surprise about the planet around 51 Pegasi: although a 
Jupiter-like planet, it appeared to be closer to 51 Pegasi than tiny Mercury is to our Sun. 
Everything astronomers believed they understood about the formation of stars and planets 
said that no planet should be that close to its star, especially not a 'gas-giant' planet similar to 
Jupiter. But there it was, zooming around 51 Pegasi once every four and a quarter days. Or so 
it seemed. 
</td></tr>
</table>
<table width="460">
<tr><td>
Over the past year, seven other planets have been detected, many of them orbiting 
surprisingly close to their parent stars. Three of these planets have 'years', known as orbital 
periods to astronomers, that are only about four days long, and one has a period of about two 
weeks. By comparison, Jupiter's period -- it's 'year' -- is about twelve Earth-years long. 
</td></tr>
</table>
<table width="460">
<tr><td>
Now, Dr David Gray, of the University of Western Ontario, Canada, reports in the 27 
February 1997 issue of the science magazine <i>Nature</i> that all is not as it seems with 
51 Pegasi. In fact, he has found that the star is pulsating in just the way needed to mimic the 
signature of a planet in orbit around the star. This is a new and unexpected type of oscillation, 
which is why Drs Mayor and Queloz discounted that explanation for their results, but their 
equipment did not have the ability to measure the subtle variations that Dr Gray has found. 
</td></tr>
</table>
<table width="460">
<tr><td>
A number of research groups have been searching for extra-solar planets, mainly looking for 
systematic shifts in the spectral lines in the atmospheres of stars like the Sun. Although we 
commonly speak of planets orbiting the Sun or a star, they actually orbit a common point, 
called the centre of mass. The centre of mass of the Sun-Jupiter system is just above the 
surface of the Sun, so the Sun doesn't move very much as Jupiter goes around it. (The other 
planets have much smaller effects on the motion of the Sun, and can for all practical purposes 
be ignored.) The larger the planet, or the closer it is to a star, the more quickly the star will 
move. 
</td></tr>
</table>
<table width="460">
<tr><td>
This motion is reflected in the positions of characteristic 'lines' in the spectrum of light from a 
star, which arise from elements such as iron, calcium and sodium, in the gas above the star's 
surface. The spectral lines are all shifted from their 'rest positions' in one direction as the star 
comes towards us ('blueshift'), and in the opposite direction as the star goes away from us 
('redshift'). The size of the shift, combined with a measurement of the period of the orbit, tells 
astronomers how massive the planet is, and how far it is from the star. 
</td></tr>
</table>
<table width="460">
<tr><td>
This line-shifting is a manifestation of the Doppler effect. The usual example of the 
ambulance siren is still the best way of explaining the phenomenon: imagine you are standing 
at the kerb while an ambulance rushes past you on the street, siren wailing. The pitch of the 
siren sounds higher as the ambulance approaches you than when it recedes into the distance. 
As with ambulance sirens, so with the spectra of light from stars as they wobble around the 
centre of mass of the star-planet system, alternately approaching and receding from the Earth 
with each rotation. 
</td></tr>
</table>
<table width="460">
<tr><td>
Although simple in theory, the measurement is very difficult in practice. Dr Gordon Walker 
of the University of British Columbia, who developed the technique now in use around the 
world, spent much of his career looking for planets, but never finding one. He did find a 
number of stars which oscillated in just the right way to mimic the signature of a planet, and 
he has therefore always urged caution in leaping to the conclusion that Dr Mayor and Dr 
Queloz's data demonstrated the presence of a planet. His caution has now been vindicated. 
</td></tr>
</table>
<table width="460">
<tr><td>
Dr Gray has found that the spectral lines aren't really redshifted or blueshifted, rather the line 
shapes change just the right amount, and with just the right period, to explain the apparent 
shifts. A crude analogy is that of a boat on the ocean. As the waves pass under the boat, it 
rises and falls systematically. If you couldn't see the water itself, you might conclude that the 
boat is rising and falling because the general level of the water is changing, as it does with the 
tide: you needn't know anything about waves. This is like the situation where the presence of 
planets was inferred from the data. But, if you look more closely, you'll see that in fact it is 
the waves passing underneath the boat that causes it to rise and fall, not a general rise and fall 
in the level of the ocean. This is analogous to what Gray has done -- he's looked more closely 
at the spectrum of 51 Peg, and seen the line shapes changing. 
</td></tr>
</table>
<table width="460">
<tr><td>
No criticism of Drs Mayor and Queloz is intended or justified -- they did the best they could 
with their equipment, and realized that someone might eventually find just what Gray has 
seen. That's the way science works. 
</td></tr>
</table>
<table width="460">
<tr><td>
Another group, based at San Francisco State University, posted a rebuttal of
Gray's paper on their world-wide web page 
(<A HREF="http://exoplanets.org/nrp.html">http://cannon.sfsu.edu/~williams/planetsearch/nrp.html</A>) last week, before the appearance of 
Dr Gray's paper in <i>Nature</i>: meaning that astronomers were unable to assess the 
merits of Dr Gray's arguments at the same time as the rebuttal. A substantial part of the 
rebuttal is based on a paper to be published in the <i>Astrophysical Journal</i> by Dr Artie 
Hatzes, of the University of Texas at Austin. 
</td></tr>
</table>
<table width="460">
<tr><td>
In particular, a quote from the paper to the effect that Dr Hatzes did not see variation in the 
line shapes is given special prominence in the rebuttal. Dr Hatzes made measurements similar 
to those by Dr Gray, but he was very careful to explain in his paper that he had insufficient 
data to rule out the kind of oscillation seen by Gray. This important message was not 
reproduced in the rebuttal. 
</td></tr>
</table>
<table width="460">
<tr><td>
Dr Gray's work leaves a question-mark over the presence of other extra-solar planets. He 
suggests that the four candidate planets with orbital periods less than about two weeks need to 
be re-examined carefully, to see if they show the same effect he sees in 51 Pegasi. This will 
be a slow, arduous process. The existence of the four remaining planets with longer periods is 
not being questioned at this time, but astronomers undoubtedly will be looking more closely 
at them as well. While almost all astronomers agree that there probably are planets around 
most stars, it will be some time before their presence is demonstrated conclusively.
