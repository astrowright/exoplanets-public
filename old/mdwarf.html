51&nbsp;Peg's Companion: Planet or Star?
<FONT COLOR="#700GG">

<h3>Tidal coupling would 
be expected if 51&nbsp;Peg's companion
were a full-fledged star.  But the coupling hasn't occurred.  
Therefore, the companion has a mass much less than that of an H-burning star.</h3>

If the orbital plane of the
companion to 51&nbsp;Peg is nearly face-on,
the mass of the companion to 51&nbsp;Peg could be
much greater than 0.45 M<SUB>jup</SUB>, indeed arbitrarily high.
<P>
M&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.45&nbsp;Jupiter-Masses&nbsp;/&nbsp;sin&nbsp;<VAR>i</VAR>
<P>
where <VAR>i</VAR> is the inclination of the orbit (0 for face-on).
<p>
The statistical probability that the orbital plane is inclined sufficiently 
face-on that M&nbsp;>&nbsp;50&nbsp;M<SUB>JUP</SUB> is:  Probability&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.0001 .  
<P>
Since Mayor's group and we have observed 
only 260 stars, it is unlikely 
that such an extreme face-on orientation would occur.
<P>
More importantly, the weak chromospheric and coronal emission
of 51&nbsp;Peg rule out a close stellar companion.
The weak corona and chromosphere imply a spin period of, 
P<SUB>rot</SUB>&nbsp;~&nbsp;35&nbsp;d.
This slow spin period for the star (compared 
to the planet's orbital period of 4.2 day) 
shows that the planet orbits the star faster than 51&nbsp;Peg 
spins on axis. 
This slow spin rate for the star rules out significant tidal coupling between
the planet and the star.  <h4>Such tidal coupling would 
be expected if 51&nbsp;Peg's companion
were a full-fledged star.  But the coupling hasn't occurred.  
Therefore, the companion has very low mass, not a star.</h4>

<P>
The suggestion that the differential rotation
might not occur for tidally-coupled stars (thereby artificially
supressing the magnetic-driven chromosphere)
is empirically not born out.
Many close STELLAR binaries are known
having orbital periods of 2 - 6 days, the same orbital periods as 51 Peg.
These Solar-type star binaries have X-ray luminosities (ROSAT)
of typically:  
<P>

Log(Lx) = 29.  for G-dwarf binaries
<P>
In contrast, 
<P>
log(Lx) = 27.0  for 51&nbsp;Peg
<P>
The coronal X-ray flux from 51&nbsp;Peg
is too low, inconsistent (at the 5-sigma level) with a 
close stellar companion.  Again, the companion obviously can't be a star.
For a thorough discussion of this, see:

<P>
Further, its age of ~8Gyr implies that tidal
coupling would have easily occurred
in 51&nbsp;Peg.  But it hasn't, thus ruling out a close stellar companion.
