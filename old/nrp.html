<MULTICOL cols=2>
Dr. David Gray (Univ. Western Ontario) published
a paper in <EM>Nature</EM> (1997, vol.385, p795),
suggesting that some undulations or oscillations
in the star, 51&nbsp;Peg, are responsible for the
Doppler shifts, rather than an orbiting planet.
Gray states, ``Oscillatory upheavals in the
star's atmosphere could reshape spectral lines
through their Doppler shifts and altered
radiation transfer.'' Gray's paper indicates that
spectral lines vary in shape with a periodicity
of 4.23 days, based on 39 spectra taken over 8
years.

<h2>
<u>Detailed Discussion of Gray's Claim of Pulsations</u></h2>

<h3>
I. Are the Spectral Lines Truly Varying?</h3>

<blockquote>Dr. Gray's paper claims that the asymmetry in the spectral
lines of 51&nbsp;Peg vary with an amplitude of 45&nbsp;m/s. However his errors are
probably ~20&nbsp;m/s. One cannot determine these errors, as Nature publishes
papers without mention of uncertainties or error bars. The supposed extent
of variations in the line-profiles is only twice the errors we estimate. Thus,
Gray's effect must be confirmed. Further, in the persuasive "binned" plot,
Gray and Nature binned the data points together according to ``natural
groupings of the points''. The data points are thus grouped together by
eye, rather than in equal intervals.
<p>Another paper accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal
by Hatzes, Cochran, and Johns-Krull states:
<p>``We find no evidence for variability in the velocity span of the spectral
line bisectors greater than the error of the measurements (sigma&nbsp;=&nbsp;20&nbsp;m/s).''
<P>These spectral line shapes were obtained using 50% higher spectral
resolution, and they include analysis of eight spectral lines. Dr. Gray
included only one line to derive the line asymmetry. However, the lines
were measured slightly differently by the two research groups; perhaps
Gray's measurements are intrinsically more sensitive to oscillations, though
there is no evidence of this. The Hatzes paper sampled 51&nbsp;Peg at only 3
different phases. Thus, Dr. Hatzes notes that he can neither confirm nor
reject Dr. Gray's claim.</blockquote>

<h2>
II. No Brightness Variations Occur in 51&nbsp;Peg Stars</h2>

<blockquote><a href="henry_51Peg.gif">Photometry
of the star 51&nbsp;Peg</a> shows no brightness variations, with a two-sigma
limit of 0.04%. The upper limit of brightness variations is 0.0004&nbsp;mag
(= 0.04%) for all four 51&nbsp;Peg-type stars <a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/ApJ/journal/issues/ApJ/v474n1/34319/34319.html">
(Greg Henry et al. 1996 </a>,
<a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/ApJ/journal/issues/ApJL/v474n2/5583/5583.html">Sallie
Baliunas et al. 1997).</a> However, oscillating stars should exhibit brightness
variations which are periodic with the oscillations. The Cepheid pulsating
stars are the best known example.
<P>This 0.04% observed upper limit on the brightness variations is
a factor of 3 less than expected for non-radial oscillations, given the
velocity amplitude of 57&nbsp;m/s for 51&nbsp;Peg (Hatzes et al. 1997). Therefore,
51&nbsp;Peg does not show the brightness variations that should accompany the
putative "oscillations" This argument is not ironclad, because Dr. Gray
prefers to invoke oscillations of an unknown nature, thereby leaving us
with no predictive model of the oscillations .
<P>A stronger case applies to the star, <a href="5185/5185.html">Tau
Bo&ouml;tis</a>, that is a ``51&nbsp;Peg-like'' star: It exhibits sine-wave Doppler
variations having amplitude of 470&nbsp;m/s with a 3.3-day period. These are
easily interpreted as due to an orbiting planet having mass of 3.8 Jupiter
masses.
<P>In Dr. Gray's hypothesis, the Doppler variations of Tau Bo&ouml;tis
are instead due to oscillations. However, no variations in the shapes of
its spectral lines are seen at all (see IV below). Furthermore, the pulsation
velocity, during 1/4 period, implies that the photosphere moves by 3% of
a stellar radius. These large amplitudes imply significant sloshing of
fliud on the stellar surface, and the speed of the fluid would be about
1 km/s, 1/8 of sound speed. In contrast to this supposed oscillatory surface
activity, the observed upper limit of brightness variations is only 0.04%
for Tau Bo&ouml;tis. If oscillations were actually occuring, there should be
brightness variations of at least 0.5%, which are clearly ruled out by
the known constancy (below 0.04%) of the light from Tau Bo&ouml;tis. There is
no plausible oscillation model whereby a star would exhibit Doppler variations
of 470&nbsp;m/s, thereby distorting the stellar surface by several percent of
the star's radius, and yet show no brightness variation. Indeed, Gray's
paper does not contain any such oscillation model or concept.
<br>
<br>
<p>However, non-radial oscillation modes having high radial number,
<VAR>n</VAR>,
might provide such a model. If so, the star must somehow "choose" only
one value of <VAR>n</VAR>. Calculations by Greg Ushomirsky (UC Berkeley) shows that
the 115th harmonic mode would produce the observed Doppler amplitude (56
m/s) and yield the correct period (4.23 days). However the neighboring
modes (112,113,114,116,117,118, etc.) should also be excited, as they differ
in period by only 1% from the 4.23-day mode. Where are the other modes:
they are not seen in the Doppler periodicity.?
<p>The Chromopshere of 51&nbsp;Peg also shows no periodicity at the Doppler
period of 4.23&nbsp;d, based on our 200 spectra of the <a href="51peg_chrom.jpg">Ca
II Infrared triplet lines.</a></blockquote>

<h2>
III. The Doppler Variations Exhibit Only One Period and One Amplitude.</h2>

<blockquote>All four 51&nbsp;Peg-like stars show Doppler variations that are
sine waves. For example, the Doppler variations of
<a href="51Peg.html">51
Pegasi </a>are indistinguishable from a sine wave.
<br>
<br>
<p>THERE ARE NO OTHER PERIODS IN THE DOPPLER VARIATIONS.
<p><a href="51peg_periodogram.tif">A
PERIODOGRAM </a>(Power spectrum) of the Doppler measurements for 51&nbsp;Peg
shows only one peak, at the period of 4.231 days. There are no other significant
peaks. All of the small peaks visible near the base of the strong peak
are simply false "aliases" of the main 4.23-day periodicity, due to the
actual times of observation of 51&nbsp;Peg. We have synthesized this effect,
reproducing both the width of the main peak and the false (aliased) small
peaks.
<h3>
51&nbsp;Peg EXHIBITS A DELTA FUNCTION IN DOPPLER FREQUENCY.</h3>
THERE ARE NO OTHER OVERTONES OR HARMONICS.
<p>The measured velocities scatter from a perfect sine wave by 5&nbsp;m/s&nbsp;(RMS).
The residual discrepancies between our measured velocities and the Keplerian
velocity curve are simply due to our Doppler uncertainties. Indeed, the
<a href="51peg_res.tif">velocity
"residuals"</a> are no larger than our predicted errors based on the Number
of Photons collected in the spectrum.
<h2>
The additional Doppler signals due to "sloshing modes" or overtones that
normally accompany oscillations are absent.</h2>
If interpreted as some exotic non-radial pulsation, the star somehow "rings"
perfectly to yield a sine wave with only one exact oscillation period.
Even perfectly tuned violin strings and bells exhibit multiple "modes"
and harmonics as they oscillate. Our Sun shows many <a href="m_average_0_10.gif">acoustic</a>
modes. But 51&nbsp;Peg only exhibits the 4.23-day period. Nor do any of the
other 51&nbsp;Peg-like stars show multiple modes. Oscillations in nature (even
those man-made) are never as pure as the single-period that 51&nbsp;Peg exhibits
in its Doppler variations. This pure periodicity in 51&nbsp;Peg strongly argues
against any "oscillation" explanation.
<P>Further, the Doppler amplitude of 57&nbsp;m/s remains constant over
time. If interpreted as non-radial oscillations, there is no apparent ``damping''
or friction. The "oscillation" hypothesis forces us to adopt some oscillation
that "selects" only one frequency and continues ringing without changing
frequency or amplitude.
<p>There is no known physics that would "pick out" only one non-radial
mode, to the exclusion of all others. Indeed other non-radial pulsators
(i.e., delta Scuti stars) show a large range of modes that switch from
one to the other, as is physically understandable.
<br>
<br>
</blockquote>

<h2>
IV. Tau Bo&ouml;tis shows no oscillations.</h2>

<blockquote>The short-period star, Tau Bo&ouml;tis (Period=3.3 days,
M&nbsp;sin&nbsp;<VAR>i</VAR>&nbsp;=&nbsp; 3.7&nbsp;Jupiter masses),
shows no significant variations in the shapes of
the spectral lines. There are 5 Solar-type stars that exhibit Keplerian
Doppler periodicities with short-periods under 40 days (Tau Bo&ouml;tis, 51
Peg, Ups And, 55 Rho1 Cancri, Rho Cor Bor). One of these, Tau Boo, has
now been checked for variations in the spectral line shapes. Variations
in the shapes of the spectral lines are absent, at a detection level 20
times below that required to explain the Doppler periodicity. Thus, the
planet hypothesis is the only viable one for this case, the first tested.
This Tau Bo&ouml;tis work was done by the team of: Tim Brown, Scott Horner,
Sylvain Korzennik, Ed Kennelly, R.Kotak, S. Jha, M.Krockenberger, P.Nisenson,
and Robert Noyes.</blockquote>

<h2>
V. All 51&nbsp;Peg-like Stars are Solar-Like but Exhibit Different Doppler Periodicities.</h2>

<blockquote>The planet hypothesis explains the diversity of observed Doppler
periods naturally: Each star has a different planet with its own orbit
and mass.
<P>The "oscillation" hypothesis cannot explain why nearly identical
Solar-like stars would "ring" with totally different pure-tone periods
and amplitudes. Indeed, the Sun shows no such oscillation at all.

<blockquote>The four 51&nbsp;Peg-like stars are very similar. All are Sun-like,
within 10%. They all have masses between 0.9 and 1.1 of the Sun's mass.
<p>However, the periods of the Doppler variations and the amplitudes are
quite different (by a factor of 10 in amplitude and a factor of 4 in period).
A hypothesis that these similar stars are "oscillating" fails to explain
the great differences in the periods and amplitudes. Objects in nature
ring or oscillate with frequencies that depend only on their size and construction
(such as the period of a pendulum or the pitch of a violin string.) These
similar stars, if oscillating, disobey that critical rule, since they are
similar in structure, yet so different in observed resonance properties.
<P>Further, the Doppler characteristics are uncorrelated with spectral
type, or any other stellar parameter. There is no physics of oscillations
that can explain the large differences in Doppler peridicities, for such
similar Sun-like stars.</blockquote>

VI. Non-Radial Pulsation (NRP) Plausibility</h2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<OL type=a>
<LI> What plausibly excites these different oscillation modes
in each star?
<P><LI> What maintains the amplitude for hundreds of cycles, with no
decay?</P>
<P><LI> If oscillations are correct, why do only a few F and G stars
show the 51&nbsp;Peg phenomenon?</P>
<P>The 51&nbsp;Peg phenomenon is absent in the Sun and dozens of other
G dwarfs in our sample. But the 51&nbsp;Peg phenomenon is not confined to evolved
Solar-type stars. The other three members aren't old.
<p>The rarity of the 51&nbsp;Peg phenomenon is explained naturally within the
planet interpretation as due to the diversity of protoplanetary disks,
seen clearly in the Hubble Space telescope images of young stars in Orion.
Therefore, some stars are endowed with disks that yield planets. The "oscillation"
hypothesis offers no such explanation for the existence of oscillations
for a few stars, but not the rest.
<P><LI> How can oscillations be excited with VERY DIFFERENT dominant mode
frequencies and different amplitudes, both being independent of stellar
properties. That is, 55 Rho1 Cnc has a 14.7-day period, while Tau Boo has
a 3.3-day period. Different planetary orbits explains this easily, while
no oscillation explanation exists.

VIII. Possible Reconciliation: The Planet Exerts Gravitational Forces on
Star</h2>

<blockquote>A planet provides a natural gravitational DRIVER for non-radial
oscillations. The planet certainly raises tides on the star, though they
would occur TWICE per 4.2-day orbital period, which is not seen in Gray's
data.
<P>Nonetheless, it is conceivable that the gravitational forces exerted
by the planet on the turbulent, convective photospere of the star could
alter the basic gas flows. In this model, the planet alters the flows,
which have intrinsic velocities of about 1000&nbsp;m/s, by a small fraction.
This could yield changes in the line shapes by some tens of m/s.
<P>Alternatively, the gravity of the planet could serve as the driver
of resonances in the star, such as buoyant modes, or "gravity-modes".
<P>This gravitational explanation would yield constant amplitude,
phase and period in a star. The travelling bulge on the star could explain
the spectral line variations that Dave Gray suggests. The orbiting planet
could excite one (and only one) particular natural mode or oscillation
period within the star. Thus, the spectroscopic observations by Gray could
represent a remarkable confirmation of the close planet. However, the above
reconciliations represent completely ad hoc efforts to include Gray's observed
line-prorile variations, which remain in need of confirmation. Models to
explain them seem implausible.</blockquote>

<h2>SUMMARY</h2>

<font color="#000099">

There are several possible interpretations of the
present data for 51&nbsp;Pegasi:

<OL>

<LI> There is no planet, but instead there is an
intrinsic, single-frequency pulsation, of single
mode, having unknown excitation mechanism and an
unknown nature. It is present in 51&nbsp;Peg and
in some rare solar type stars, but is somehow not
present in the Sun.

<P><LI> There is a low frequency pulsation that
is excited by the gravity of the planet. This
possibility at least would have the advantage of
explaining the stable, single period
observed.</P>

<P><LI> The asymmetrical shape of the absorption
lines of any solar-type star is caused by
radiative transfer of light in the atmosphere
just above the convective zone. The gravitational
perturbation of the outer atmosphere by the
planet will affect the velocities of the
convective cells and the shape of the lines. This
case probably will not affect the global
luminosity too much.</P>

<P><LI> The outer atmosphere of the planet
eclipses the star. This was first suggested in a
paper entitled, `The cometary-like tail of giant
extrasolar planets in close orbit', (1997, J.
Schneider, H. Rauer, Lasota J.-P., Bonazzola S.
and Chassefi&egrave;re E.), submitted to the
Proceedings of the `Workshop on Brown Dwarfs and
Extrasolar Planets' held in Tenerife in March
1997.</P>

<P><LI> The data from Dr. Gray may be incorrect.
The quoted change in the velocity span of 45&nbsp;m/s
is only somewhat larger than the errors of 20
m/s. The "oscillation" conclusion by Dr. Gray is
not empirically strong, is not confirmed, and is
difficult to understand in terms of oscillation
physics.</P>
