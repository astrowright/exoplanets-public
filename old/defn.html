<p>
We define ``planet'' as follows.

<b>  A ``planet'' is an object that has a mass between 
  that of Pluto and the Deuterium-burning threshold* &nbsp and 
  that forms in orbit around an object that can generate energy by
  nuclear reactions.

*<b><em> Deuterium Burning Limit:</em></b>  Objects less 
massive than 13 Jupiter masses never burn Deuterium nor
generate significant energy from any nuclear reactions. 
Fortuitously, this Deuterium-burning limit at 13 Mjup
resides near the upper-end of the observed planet mass distribution.  
Thus 13 Jupiter masses constitutes an arbitrary but doubley motivated limit.
<p>
<b><em>Corollary #1:</em></b>  &nbsp&nbsp Observations may enhance but not authenticate
planet status.  
<p>
<b><em>Corollary #2:</em></b>  &nbsp&nbsp Sharp parameter boundaries
for the domain of "planets" can be neither
physically nor empirically justified at this time.  Objects which have 
masses and formation histories near the perimeter of the adopted
parameter domain constitute part of a natural continuum.
<p>

<b><em>Upper Mass Limit for Planets:</em></b><br>
The <A HREF="http://www.exoplanets.org/msini_hist.jpg">observed mass distribution of companions</a> 
to nearby stars motivates the upper mass limit. 
Without the empirical mass distribution,
no upper mass limit would be compelling.  
<p>
The mass distribution exhibits a
clear paucity above 5 to 10 Mjup.  Less than 1% of stars harbor
companions having more than 10 Mjup within 10 AU .  The mass distribution
rises steeply toward smaller masses, down 
to the detection limit near 1 Mjup.  This mass distribution 
empirically motivates an upper boundary for 
planetary masses at about 10 Mjup.  
<p>

<h4>
Thus the empirically-based upper mass limit for planets resides at 10
M<sub>JUP</sub> and coincides conveniently with the boundary of nuclear
Deuterium burning at 13 Mjup, making this proposed upper mass limit 
for planets analogous to the substellar boundary for H-burning.
