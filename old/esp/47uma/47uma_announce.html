<P><STRONG>Berkeley</STRONG> - With the help of improved measurement techniques, 
planet hunters at the University of California, Berkeley, have been 
able to detect a Jupiter-sized planet orbiting a nearby star at a 
distance comparable to Jupiter in our own solar system.</P>
<P>Planets this size and distance from their star produce slight 
long-period wobbles in the motion of the star that until now  
have been impossible to detect.</P>
<P>The UC Berkeley astronomers found the planet, which is at 
least three-quarters the size of Jupiter, orbiting the star 47 Ursae 
Majoris (47 UMa) in the Big Dipper - Ursa Major or the Big Bear - a 
star known already to have one orbiting planet 2.5 times bigger than 
Jupiter. Both planets are in nearly circular orbits that in our solar 
system would be located beyond Mars but within the orbit of Jupiter.</P>
<P>"For the first time we have detected two planets in nearly 
circular orbits around the same star," said Debra Fischer, an 
assistant research astronomer working with UC Berkeley astronomy 
professor Geoffrey Marcy and researcher Paul Butler of the Carnegie 
Institution of Washington. "Most of the 70 planets people have found 
to date are in bizarre solar systems, with short periods and 
eccentric orbits close to the star.</P>
<P>"As our sensitivity improves we are finally seeing planets 
with longer orbital period, planetary systems that look more like our 
solar system."</P>
<P>The star 47 UMa is one of the 100 stars that Marcy and Butler 
first targeted in 1987 when they began collecting data on stellar 
wobbles in search of evidence for planets. The 13 years' worth of 
data were obtained at Lick Observatory with the 3-meter Shane and 
0.6-meter Coude Auxillary telescopes hooked to the high-resolution 
Hamilton spectrograph - all shared with other astronomers.</P>
<P>Fischer said that the UC Berkeley team's success in finding 
extrasolar planets highlights the need for a telescope dedicated to 
planet searches, available to do the nightly monitoring necessary to 
plot the motion of bright, nearby stars and detect distant companions.</P>
<P>"We hope to raise $5 million to purchase a dedicated 
two-meter telescope that will give us the same or better efficiency, 
when coupled to the Hamilton spectrograph, as the three-meter 
telescope we use today," Fischer said. The telescope would be 
constructed on Mt. Hamilton as part of Lick Observatory.</P>
<P>"Our technique has the precision to detect tiny wobbles in 
stars and this discovery demonstrates our ability to keep a steady 
hold on that exquisite precision over many years. With a dedicated 
telescope we could begin to detect much lower mass planets - perhaps 
as low as 20 Earth masses - and Jupiter-sized planets in 
Jupiter-sized orbits."</P>
<P>Fischer, Marcy, Butler and their colleagues describe the new 
planet in a paper recently accepted for publication in Astrophysical 
Journal. Their team included Gregory Laughlin, a theoretician based 
at NASA Ames Research Center, and Steve Vogt, professor of astronomy 
and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</P>
<P>"When we discovered the first planet around 47 Ursae Majoris 
five years ago, I never dreamed that we would find yet another planet 
orbiting the same star," said Marcy. "Every new planetary system 
reveals some new quirk that we didn't expect. We've found planets in 
small orbits and wacky eccentric orbits. With 47 Ursae Majoris, it's 
heartwarming to find a  planetary system that finally reminds us of 
our solar system."</P>
<P>"The discovery of planets in circular orbits is exciting 
because they are so rare," Butler added. " Of the published planets 
with orbital periods longer than a month, only HD 27442 and this 
system are in circular orbits. From this we can make a preliminary 
guess that about five percent of planetary systems are in circular 
orbits."</P>
<P>The star 47 UMa is a yellow G0V star very similar to the Sun, 
probably about seven billion years old and located about 51 light 
years from Earth. Fischer noted that the so-called habitable zone 
around the star -a region approximately equivalent to that between 
the orbits of Venus and Mars in our solar system, an area that 
includes Earth - is devoid of large gaseous planets. This means it 
potentially could harbor an Earth-sized rock we can't yet see, and 
won't be able to see until NASA launches the next generation of 
planet hunting missions from space.</P>
<P>Based on dynamical computer simulations by Laughlin, Fischer 
cautioned that " it could be difficult for an Earth-mass terrestrial 
planet to form in a stable orbit within that habitable zone" because 
of the proximity of the two outer gas giants.</P>
<P>The inner planet circling 47 UMa was first discovered in 1996 
by Marcy and Butler using their new and precise technique for 
measuring Doppler-shifted light from stars. Regular changes in the 
Doppler shift, they thought, signaled the presence of a planet 
periodically pulling the star toward or away from Earth.</P>
<P>Fischer was able to see the periodic wobble from a second 
planet, smaller and farther from the star, because of improved 
precision - down to 3 meters per second - in measuring motion along 
the line of sight to the star.</P>
<P>"Among the published planets, only the outer planet in this 
system and HD 16141 have Doppler amplitudes smaller than Jupiter on 
the Sun," which induces a wobble of 11 meters per second, said 
Butler. "Our long range goal remains the detection of true Jupiter 
analogs - bona fide solar system analogs - to allow us to compare our 
solar system to other planetary systems."</P>
<P>In addition, 13 years of data from the star allowed Fischer 
to tease out a wobble with a 7.1-year period, the time it takes the 
newly discovered outer planet to orbit the star. The inner, larger 
planet orbits in 2.99 years.</P>
<P>The two-planet system bears an intriguing resemblance to our 
own. The new measurements by Fischer and her colleagues peg the mass 
of the inner planet at 2.5 times that of Jupiter, at least, while the 
newly discovered outer planet has a mass at least 3/4 that of 
Jupiter, yielding a mass ratio of 3.3. The mass ratio of Jupiter to 
Saturn is also 3.3.</P>
<P>The average distance from the star to the inner planet is 
2.09 times the average distance of the Earth from the Sun, a unit of 
measure called an astronomical unit or AU. The outer planet is 3.73 
AU from the central star. For comparison, Jupiter and Saturn are at 
distances of 5.203 and 9.555 AU, respectively.</P>
<P>The research was funded by the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration and the National Science Foundation, with equipment 
grants from Sun Microsystems.</P>
