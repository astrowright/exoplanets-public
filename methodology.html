      <h1>Documentation and Methodology</h1>

      <p>
        The Exoplanet Data Explorer (EDE) gives Web users access to
        the Exoplanet Orbit Database (EOD). Our full methodology
        is <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011PASP..123..412W">here</a>
        and is available
        on <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/1012.5676">astro-ph</a>. Description
        of major updates from the Wright et al. (2011) documentation
        can be found below (labeled with '<b>*</b>' in
        the <a href="#methodology"><b>Summary of Methodology</b></a>
        section). Questions and comments should be directed
        to <a href="mailto:datamaster@exoplanets.org">datamaster@exoplanets.org</a>.
      </p>

      <h1>FAQ</h1>

      <h4>Why should I use the EOD instead of one of the other lists
      of exoplanets?</h4>
      <p>
        If you are interested in:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The most accurate orbital ephemerides for known planets
        </li>
        <li>
          A carefully vetted list of confidently detected exoplanets
          with well measured orbital properties from the peer-reviewed literature
        </li>
        <li>
          Transit data, such as planet-star radius ratios and transit
          durations
        </li>
        <li>
          An elegant and powerful plotting tool for presentation or
          publication quality plots
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        then we believe you should use our site.  Other sites
        include announced planets whose
        properties and existence have not been scrutinized by peer review, and
        lack many of the stellar and transit fields our site has.  Our site
        has also corrected many typos appearing in the literature.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the other hand, if you want a comprehensive list of all
        planet announcements that have not been disproven so you would
        like to decide for yourself which planets to include in your
        sample; or you would like comprehensive bibliographies or
        lists of many measurements for various stellar parameters; or
        if you are looking for the data underlying these parameters,
        you may want to use another site (we list our favorite
        ones <a href="./exoplanetlinks.html">here</a>).  We use these
        sites regularly to keep up-to-date on planet discoveries, and
        we share information with them about literature errors. We
        consider these sites complementary, serving slightly different
        purposes from exoplanets.org.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Why isn't my favorite exoplanet/datum listed in the EOD? <br>
        Why does your site list fewer planets than site X?
      </h4>
      <p>
        There are four primary reasons:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The EOD contains only carefully vetted, <i>peer-reviewed</i> data.  If
          your favorite planet has not been published (or accepted for
          publication) in a peer-reviewed journal, it will not appear in this
          Database, with rare exceptions. Also, in
          a small number of cases we have made a judgement call that a peer-reviewed datum
          (or planet) is not up to the Database's standards, or uses an
          unproven method whose results we are not comfortable including.
          Basically, we have done a lot of work
          to keep an updated list of planets with "good" orbits by our own
          published and peer-reviewed criteria, and
          this database is our way to share that list with the public.
        </li>
        <li>
          We are not all-seeing;  sometimes we miss an ephemeris update,
          or even a whole planet!
          If you know of a better source of data than the reference in our
          table (or find an error!), please <a
          href="mailto:datamaster@exoplanets.org">let us know</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          We are not fast;  it can take time for us to fully digest a new
          planet announcement, decide that it warrants inclusion, enter the
          data, verify the transcription, and sync up the EOD with the EDE.  Summer updates may be
          especially slow.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Why don't the numbers in the EDE agree with the numbers in
      the reference / exported file?</h4>
      <p>
        The EDE displays data with a conservative "significant figures"
        algorithm.  The exported CSV files contain the data at the "full precision" stored
        in the database, which should be consistent with the literature values
        to machine precision.  Thus, if the literature lists a datum as 1001
        with a standard error of 100, that will appear in the CSV as such, but the EDE
        will display "1000 +/- 100" because it deems the trailing "1" not
        significant.  This concession is necessary to make the online tables
        easily readable; the machine-readable exported files have full
        fidelity to the literature.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have also made some minor modifications to data to make it
        conform to our database standards -- for instance we restrict the
        domain of little omega to [0,360).
      </p>

      <h4>Why doesn't FIRSTREF refer to this prior press release /
      poster abstract / conference proceeding?</h4>
      <p>
        The EOD contains only peer-reviewed references; see below.  The
        FIRSTREF field is not a "credit" field.
      </p>

      <h4>How do I make the Table/Plotter do what I want?</h4>
      <p>
        Try the <a href="./help/common/data">help pages</a>.  User the
        left-hand column to browse various help topics.  These pages
        include videos made for the Kepler Data Explorer.  Though they
        differ in the available planet properties, the behavior of the
        Exoplanets Data Explorer and the Kepler Data Explorer are
        identical.
      </p>

      <h4>Why doesn't the "Export" button export all of the data in the EOD?</h4>
      <p>
        The "Export" button in the EDE Table exports the table as you, the
        user, have currently displayed it.  If you would like the entire
        database, it is available in a single click on the front page,
        or <a href="./exoplanets.csv">here</a>.
      </p>


      <h1><a id="methodology">Summary of Methodology</a></h1>
      <p>
        Some of the content below is included in Wright et al. (2011)
        documentation of the EOD. Objects that are labeled with
        "*" are updates from Wright et al. (2011).
      </p>

      <h2>General</h2>

      <h4>Uncertainties</h4>
      <p>
        We have recorded literature uncertainties in stellar masses, but when
        estimating uncertainties in msini and a we conservatively assume a
        minimum uncertainty in stellar mass of 5%.  We do this to account for
        likely systematic errors in model estimates of stellar masses (limits
        in their accuracy) for most planet-bearing stars.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We now report asymmetric error bars throughout the database in
        all fields. For quantities with asymmetric uncertainties from
        the literature, we record the uncertainty field as half of the
        span between the upper and lower limits. We store the
        asymmetry in an additional field, which ends in D, as the
        value of the upper uncertainty. For instance, <i>e</i> =
        0.5<sup>+0.1</sup><sub>-0.2</sub> would be stored as three
        fields: <code><font size="4">ECC =
        0.5</font></code>, <code><font size="4">UECC =
        0.15</font></code>, and <code><font size="4">UECCD =
        0.1</font></code>.
      </p>


      <h2>Kepler Planets and Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs)*</h2>

      
      <h4>Kepler Planets*</h4>
      <p>
        The extraordinary precision of the Kepler instrument and
        detailed ground-based follow up allows planets to be detected
        purely photometrically, without the usual spectroscopic
        orbital parameter K.  Since these planets' reality can be
        established as well as any in the EOD, and since a precise
        ephemeris is available, we have opted to include Kepler
        planets in the EOD even in those cases where the planets'
        radial velocity signature has not been measured.  In these
        cases we leave the K field blank in the EDE (set to NaN in the
        EOD).  In cases where planets' masses can be constrained
        dynamically, or have upper limits due to a lack of RV
        signature, we supply the MSINI field with the appropriate
        values and reference the source of those numbers, instead of
        calculating MSINI from K.
      </p>

      <h4>Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs)*</h4>
      <p>
        The Kepler Objects of Interst (KOIs) are stars that are
        suspected to host one or more exoplanets, but yet to be
        confirmed or validated. Although they are not counted as part
        of the EOD due to their status of being 'candidates', we
        include them in our website so that these KOIs are put into
        the context of all confirmed exoplanets. To display the KOIs
        in the EDE table, check the 'Kepler' option on the upper left
        of the table (default selection only includes 'Orbit Database'
        and 'Other'). The KOIs listed in our table include two past
        Kepler data releases and the most up-to-date release from
        January 2013. The original data are from
        the <a href="http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/">NASA
        Exoplanet Archive</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
	The three fields for identifying a Kepler planet or a KOI
	are <b>KEPID*</b> (the unique Kepler star
	identifier), <b>KOI*</b> (KOI object number), and <b>KDE*</b>
	(if true, the planet/planet candidate appears in
	the <a href="http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/">Kepler
	archive</a>).
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h2>Planet Information</h2>

      <h4>Planets Discovered via Microlensing or Imaging*</h4>
      <p>
	EOD now includes planets discovered via microlensing or
	imaging (their corresponding
	<a href="planetdiscmeth">PLANETDISCMETH</a> fields are
	'Microlensing' or 'Imaging'). They can be displayed in the EDE
	table by checking the 'Other' option on the upper left of the
	table.
      </p>

      <p>
	The planets discovered via IMAGING must satisfy the criteria
	below in order to be included in the EOD (as approved by the
	QUAlity Control Board of the Exoplanet Database, QUACBED):
	<ul>
	  <li> Planet-star mass ratio q &#60; 0.024 (&#60; 24
	  M<sub>Jup</sub> for a solar mass star); and in general we
	  require (q+&sigma;<sub>q</sub>) < 0.024, where
	  &sigma;<sub>q</sub> is the uncertainty in q. </li>
	  <li> SEP &#60; 100 AU &times;
	  (M<sub>star</sub>/M<sub>sun</sub>), where SEP is the
	  semi-major axis a if a is known, and the projected
	  separation otherwise. </li>
	  <li> Confidently detected: the detection is clearly of a
	  real astrophysical source, and will unlikely later be found to
	  have been spurious. </li>
	  <li> Confidently bound: in opinion of the QUACBED the object
	  will not be later found to be unbound or a chance
	  alignment. </li>
	</ul>
	For the last two criteria, the default confidence level for
	acceptance is 95%, though it may be hard to quantify in some
	cases.
      </p>

      <p>
	We also record whether a planet is detected
	via <b>MICROLENSING*</b>, <b>TIMING*</b>, <b>IMAGING*</b>,
	and <b>ASTROMETRY*</b>. Note that a planet can have any of the
	four fields being true but have a different discovery
	method. For instance, some of the Kepler planets have TIMING =
	true, but they were not discovered via TIMING initially but
	with TRANSIT (PLANETDISCMETH = TRANSIT).
      </p>
       
      
      <h2>Stellar Parameters</h2>

      <p>
	We now record <b>GAMMA*</b>, defined as the systemic radial
	velocity of the star-planet system center of mass with respect
	to the Solar System barycenter. It is not measured for all
	systems, and there are systematic uncertainties in these
	numbers below the 1 km/s level.
      </p>
      
      
      <h2>Orbit Parameters</h2>

      <p>
        We record the published fundamental observables of single-lined
        spectroscopic binaries:  period, RV semiamplude, and eccentricity,
        argument of periastron, and time of periastron passage.  In a few
        cases of multiple planet systems, the best orbital parameters come
        from dynamical fits, and in a small number of cases (e.g. GJ 876) planet-planet interactions
        cause these elements to detectably evolve with time.  In those cases where
        osculating elements for the planets are reported, we have recorded
        those, and the epoch at which they are valid can be found in the
        reference cited in ORBREF.
      </p>

      <p>
        Where uncertainties in orbital elements are not reported in the
        literature, they remain undefined in our table.
      </p>

      <h4>m sin(i)</h4>
      <p>
        From the orbital parameters and the mass of the host star we
        calculate the "minimum mass" of the planet from the mass
        function, as described in Butler et al. 2006.  Note that we
        calculate this quantity separately for each planet in a
        multiplanet system, as though it were a singleton planet.  For
        simplicity and consistency, we always denote this quantity "m
        sin(i)", though strictly speaking it is simply the minimum
        value for the planet's mass as calculated from the mass
        function.
      </p>

      <p>
        m sin(i) will occasionally differ from the values listed in
        the paper cited in ORBREF.  The most common reason for this is
        that we have adopted a different stellar mass than that listed
        in ORBREF.  In other cases, inclinations are known from
        transits, or constrained through astrometry or dynamical
        considerations.  In a small number of cases m sin(i) was
        misreported in the original paper.
      </p>

      <p>
	For planets in systems which do not have radial velocity
	measurements, we calculate their m sin(i) values if there are
	constraints on the planet mass (MASS) and the inclination I
	(e.g., via timing). In this case, the MSINIREF field is set
	to "Calculated from MASS and I".
      </p>

      <h4>MASS*</h4>
      <p>
	We record in this field the planet mass, which is either
	directly measured (e.g., via microlensing) or calculated based
	on MSINI and a known inclination I. In the latter case, the
	MASSREF field is set to "Calculated from MSINI and I". For
	comparison purposes (especially useful when plotting), planets
	with known MSINI but not I have MASS = MSINI and MASSREF =
	"Set to MSINI; I unknown".
      </p>
      
      <h4>SEP*</h4>
      <p>
	Separation between the planet and its host star. SEP is set to
	the semi-major axis a when a is known (SEPREFF = "Set to A"),
	and the projected separation otherwise.
      </p>
	
      <h4>BIGOM*</h4>
      <p>
	Longitude of the ascending node.
      </p>
      
      <h4>a</h4>
      <p>
        We calculate orbital semi-major axes directly from Kepler's Third Law
        in all cases.  In cases where it differs from literature values, the
        usual culprit is that we have adopted a different stellar
        mass. When the system does not have a measured orbital period
        or a stellar mass estimate, the semi-major axis value 'A' is
        unavailable and set to NaN.
      </p>

      <h4>Radial velocities and orbital fit</h4>
      <p>
        The orbital fit parameters refer to the fit in ORBREF and the listed
        orbital parameters.  The corresponding RV curve is displayed in the
        upper-left of each planet's minipage, which can be accessed by
        clicking on a planet's name.  The radial velocities in this plot are
        not necessarily those of the orbital reference, but are representative
        velocities collected from the Exoplanet Archive.  This feature is not fully supported
        -- for many stars, including binaries, certain multiplanet systems,
        and those for which no velocities are published or otherwise available
        in The Exoplanet Archive, no plot is shown.
      </p>

      
      
      <h2>Transit Parameters</h2>

      <p>
	We have recorded the fundamental photometric transit parameters
	and some derived quantities as they appear in the literature.
	In some cases we calculate time of periastron passage and the
	argument of periastron, planetary density, planetary gravity, or
	the impact parameter where those elements are not listed
	explicitly.
      </p>

      <h4>Radius, density and gravity</h4>
      <p>
        Where available, we record the published radius, density,
        gravity for transiting planets from TRANSITREF, and do not
        attempt to recompute them from the transit parameters except
        where they are not otherwise available.  Therefore, these
        values may be inconsistent with the mass derived from MSINI
        and the inclination because our MSINI values may have been
        computed from different spectroscopic orbital parameters or
        assuming a different stellar mass.
      </p>
      
      <h4>DR, RR*</h4>
      <p>
	DR is the distance between the planet and the star at
	mid-transit in the unit of stellar radii. RR is the
	planet/star radius ratio.
      

      <h2>SE (Secondary Eclipse) Depth*</h2>

      <h4>SE, SEDEPTHJ, SEDEPTHH etc.</h4>
      <p>
	SE is true if the planet has at least one secondary eclipse
	detected in any of these bands: J, H, Ks, KP (Kepler
	photometry band), IRAC1 (3.6 &mu;m), IRAC2 (4.5 &mu;m), IRAC3
	(5.8 &mu;m), and IRAC4 (8.0 &mu;m). The fields SEDEPTHJ,
	SEDEPTHH, ... , SEDEPTH80 are the secondary eclipse
	depths in these bands (in relative flux; unitless).
      </p>
      
      
      <h2>Fit & References</h2>

      <h4><a id="planetdiscmeth">PLANETDISCMETH</a>, STARDISCMETH*</h4>
      <p>
        We have replaced the field DISCMETH with two new fields:
        PLANETDISCMETH and STARDISCMETH. PLANETDISCMETH documents the
        method of discovery for a specific planet, while STARDISCMETH
        documents the method of discovery for the first planet
        discovered in a system.
      </p>
      
      <h4>References</h4>
      <p>
        We have added references and URL fields for nearly every field
        in the EOD;  all data in these fields are now uniquely
        referenced.  The only fields without rigorous citations are
        those containing coordinates, magnitudes, and rotation/activity measurements.
      </p>

      <h4>FIRSTREF</h4>
      <p>
        The "first reference" field cites the first peer-reviewed
        journal article to contain a orbital solution and/or radial
        velocities documenting the existence of the planet.  In many cases
        this does not correspond to the first public announcement of a
        planet's existence, which may have been by press release, in
        conference proceedings, or by reference in another paper.  A list of
        planet discoveries, confirmations, and discovery claims is available
        at <a href="http://obswww.unige.ch/~naef/who_discovered_that_planet.html">http://obswww.unige.ch/~naef/who_discovered_that_planet.html</a>.
      </p>
      
      <h2> Stellar Properties </h2>
      
      <h4>RSTAR*</h4>
      <p>
        For stars with transiting planets, we record the radius with asymmetrical error bars when it is calculated in the literature.
        For other stars with masses less than 0.6 Solar mass, we apply
        the formula of <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010A%26ARv..18...67T">Torres et al (2010)</a> to our recorded spectroscopic parameters, log(g), Teff,
        and [Fe/H].   The Torres formula has systematic errors of no more than 3%.  We propagate errors from our spectroscopic parameters assuming no
        covariance into the field URSTAR.
      </p>

      <h4>RHOSTAR*</h4>
      <p>
	Density of star as measured from transit photometry and radial
	velocity information, and for some cases from asteroseismology.
      </p>

      <h4>KP*</h4>
      <p>
	Magnitude in the Kepler photometry band in the optical from
	400 to 865 nm. 

      <h4>JHK Photometry</h4>
      <p>
        JHK photometry is from the <a href="http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/releases/allsky/">2MASS point source catalog</a> (Skrutskie et
        al. 2006).  In most cases
        coordinates come from the van Leeuwen (2008) rereduction of the
        Hipparcos data.  B and V magnitudes are heterogeneous, coming
        variously from the Hipparcos catalog, SIMBAD, and other literature
        sources, and so are not strictly all on the same scale.  Chromospheric
        activity measurements are from various sources, usually planet
        discovery papers plus references cited in Butler et al. (2006).

      <h4>Parallaxes</h4>
      <p>
        We have adopted the van Leeuwen (2008) parallaxes (from a rereduction of the Hipparcos data)
        for most stars.
