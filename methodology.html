      <h1>Documentation and Methodology</h1>

      <p>
        The Exoplanet Data Explorer (EDE) gives Web users access to the Exoplanet Orbit Database (EOD). Our full methodology is <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011PASP..123..412W">here</a> and is available on <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/1012.5676">astro-ph</a>.
      </p>

      <h1>FAQ</h1>

      <h4>Why should I use the EOD instead of one of the other lists ofexoplanets?</h4>
      <p>
        If you are interested in:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The most accurate orbital ephemerides for known planets
        </li>
        <li>
          A carefully vetted list of confidently detected exoplanets
          with well measured orbital properties from the peer-reviewed literature
        </li>
        <li>
          Transit data, such as planet-star radius ratios and transit
          durations
        </li>
        <li>
          An elegant and powerful plotting tool for presentation or
          publication quality plots
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        then we believe you should use our site.  Other sites
        include announced planets whose
        properties and existence have not been scrutinized by peer review, and
        lack many of the stellar and transit fields our site has.  Our site
        has also corrected many typos appearing in the literature.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the other hand, if you want a comprehensive list of all planet
        announcements that have not been disproven; or a list of real planets
        that lack well-measured orbits (including microlensing planets and
        imaged planets); or planets orbiting things other than single,
        "ordinary" stars (like pulsars, white dwarfs, or hot subdwarfs); or
        you would like to decide for yourself which planets to include in your
        sample, you should use another site (we list our favorite ones <a
        href="./exoplanetlinks.html">here</a>).  We use these sites regularly
        to keep up-to-date on planet discoveries, and we share
        information with them about literature errors. We consider these
        sites complementary, serving slightly different purposes from exoplanets.org.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Why isn't my favorite exoplanet/datum listed in the EOD? <br>
        Why does your site list fewer planets than site X?
      </h4>
      <p>
        There are four primary reasons:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The EOD contains only carefully vetted, <i>peer-reviewed</i> data.  If
          your favorite planet has not been published (or accepted for
          publication) in a peer-reviewed journal, it will not appear in this
          Database, with rare exceptions. Also, in
          a small number of cases we have made a judgement call that a peer-reviewed datum
          (or planet) is not up to the Database's standards, or uses an
          unproven method whose results we are not comfortable including.
          Basically, we have done a lot of work
          to keep an updated list of planets with "good" orbits by our own
          published and peer-reviewed criteria, and
          this database is our way to share that list with the public.
        </li>
        <li>
          The EOD is a database of stellar properties, transit parameters,
          and orbital elements of planets around "normal" stars.  If an
          exoplanet's orbit is not well measured (because it was discovered via
          imaging, for instance),
          it is not in our database
        </li>
        <li>
          We are not all-seeing;  sometimes we miss an ephemeris update,
          or even a whole planet!
          If you know of a better source of data than the reference in our
          table (or find an error!), please <a
          href="mailto:datamaster@exoplanets.org">let us know</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          We are not fast;  it can take time for us to fully digest a new
          planet announcement, decide that it warrants inclusion, enter the
          data, verify the transcription, and sync up the EOD with the EDE.  Summer updates may be
          especially slow.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Why don't the numbers in the EDE agree with the numbers in
      the reference / exported file?</h4>
      <p>
        The EDE displays data with a conservative "significant figures"
        algorithm.  The exported CSV files contain the data at the "full precision" stored
        in the database, which should be consistent with the literature values
        to machine precision.  Thus, if the literature lists a datum as 1001
        with a standard error of 100, that will appear in the CSV as such, but the EDE
        will display "1000 +/- 100" because it deems the trailing "1" not
        significant.  This concession is necessary to make the online tables
        easily readable; the machine-readable exported files have full
        fidelity to the literature.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have also made some minor modifications to data to make it
        conform to our database standards -- for instance we restrict the
        domain of little omega to [0,360).
      </p>

      <h4>Why doesn't FIRSTREF refer to this prior press release / posterabstract / conference proceeding?</h4>
      <p>
        The EOD contains only peer-reviewed references; see below.  The
        FIRSTREF field is not a "credit" field.
      </p>

      <h4>How do I make the Table/Plotter do what I want?</h4>
      <p>
        Try the <a href="./help/common/data">help pages</a>.  User the left-hand column to browse various help topics.  These pages include videos made for the Kepler Data Explorer.  Though they differ in the available planet properties, the behavior of the Exoplanets Data Explorer and the Kepler Data Explorer are identical.
      </p>

      <h4>Why doesn't the "Export" button export all of the data in the EOD?</h4>
      <p>
        The "Export" button in the EDE Table exports the table as you, the
        user, have currently displayed it.  If you would like the entire
        database, it is available in a single click on the front page,
        or <a href="./exoplanets.csv">here</a>.
      </p>

      <h1>Major Updates</h1>
      <p>
        Some recent updates as of March 2013 (these updates will also be
        described in details in our upcoming paper):
      </p>

      <h4>Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs)</h4>
      <p>
        The Kepler Objects of Interst (KOIs) are stars that are
        suspected to host one or more exoplanets, but yet to be
        confirmed or validated. Although they are not counted as part
        of the EOD due to their candidacy status, we include them in
        our website so that these KOIs are put into the context of all
        confirmed exoplanets. The KOIs listed in our table include two
        past Kepler data releases and the most up-to-date release from
        January 2013. The original data are from
        the <a href="http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/">NASA
        Exoplanet Archive</a>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The most important updates from the Wright et al. 2011 documentation of the EODs are below:
      </p>

      <h4>RSTAR</h4>
      <p>
        For stars with transiting planets, we record the radius with asymmetrical error bars when it is calculated in the literature.
        For other stars with masses less than 0.6 Solar mass, we apply
        the formula of <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010A%26ARv..18...67T">Torres et al (2010)</a> to our recorded spectroscopic parameters, log(g), Teff,
        and [Fe/H].   The Torres formula has systematic errors of no more than 3%.  We propagate errors from our spectroscopic parameters assuming no
        covariance into the field URSTAR.
      </p>

      <h4>Kepler planets</h4>
      <p>
        The extraordinary precision of the Kepler instrument and detailed ground-based follow up allows planets to be detected purely photometrically, without the usual spectroscopic orbital parameter K.
        Since these planets' reality can be established as well as any in the EOD, and since a precise ephemeris is available, we have opted to include Kepler planets in the EOD even in those cases
        where the planets' radial velocity signature has not been
        measured.  In these cases we leave the K field blank in the EDE
        (set to NaN in the EOD).
        In cases where planets' masses can be constrained dynamically,
        or have upper limits due to a lack of RV signature, we supply
        the MSINI field with the appropriate values and reference the
        source of those numbers, instead of calculating MSINI from K.
      </p>

      <h4>References</h4>
      <p>
        We have added references and URL fields for nearly every field
        in the EOD;  all data in these fields are now uniquely
        referenced.  The only fields without rigorous citations are
        those containing coordinates, magnitudes, and rotation/activity measurements.
      </p>

      <h4>Asymmetric uncertainties</h4>
      <p>
        We are updating asymmetric error bars throughout the database
        in all fields.
      </p>

      <h1>Summary of Methodology</h1>
      <p>
        The text below is subject to the updates above.
      </p>

      <h4>Orbital parameters:</h4>
      <p>
        We record the published fundamental observables of single-lined
        spectroscopic binaries:  period, RV semiamplude, and eccentricity,
        argument of periastron, and time of periastron passage.  In a few
        cases of multiple planet systems, the best orbital parameters come
        from dynamical fits, and in a small number of cases (e.g. GJ 876) planet-planet interactions
        cause these elements to detectably evolve with time.  In those cases where
        osculating elements for the planets are reported, we have recorded
        those, and the epoch at which they are valid can be found in the
        reference cited in ORBREF.
      </p>

      <p>
        Where uncertainties in orbital elements are not reported in the
        literature, they remain undefined in our table.
      </p>

      <h4>m sin(i)</h4>
      <p>
        From the orbital parameters and the mass of the host star we calculate
        the "minimum mass" of the planet from the mass function, as described
        in Butler et al. 2006.  Note that we calculate this quantity
        separately for each planet in a multiplanet system, as though it were
        a singleton planet.  For simplicity and consistency, we always denote
        this quantity "m sin(i)", though strictly speaking it is simply the
        minimum value for the planet's mass as calculated from the mass
        function.
      </p>

      <p>
        m sini will occasionally differ from the values listed in the paper
        cited in ORBREF.  The most common reason for this is that we have
        adopted a different stellar mass than that listed in ORBREF.  In other
        cases, inclinations are known from transits, or constrained through
        astrometry or dynamical considerations.  In a small number of cases m sin (i)
        was misreported in the original paper.
      </p>

      <h4>a</h4>
      <p>
        We calculate orbital semimajor axes directly from Kepler's Third Law
        in all cases.  In cases where it differs from literature values, the
        usual culprit is that we have adopted a different stellar mass.
      </p>

      <h4>Radial velocities and orbital fit</h4>
      <p>
        The orbital fit parameters refer to the fit in ORBREF and the listed
        orbital parameters.  The corresponding RV curve is displayed in the
        upper-left of each planet's minipage, which can be accessed by
        clicking on a planet's name.  The radial velocities in this plot are
        not necessarily those of the orbital reference, but are representative
        velocities collected from NStED.  This feature is not fully supported
        -- for many stars, including binaries, certain multiplanet systems,
        and those for which no velocities are published or otherwise available
        in NStED, no plot is shown.
      </p>

      <h4>Parallaxes</h4>
      <p>
        We have adopted the van Leeuwen (2008) parallaxes (from a rereduction of the Hipparcos data)
        for most stars.
      </p>

      <h4>Transiting planets</h4>
      <p>
        We have recorded the fundamental photometric transit parameters and
        some derived quantities as they appear in the literature.  In some cases we
        calculate time of periastron passage and the argument of periastron,
        planetary density, planetary gravity, or the impact parameter where
        those elements are not listed explicitly.
      </p>

      <h4>Radius, density and gravity</h4>
      <p>
        Where available, we record the published radius, density, gravity for transiting
        planets from TRANSITREF, and do not attempt to recompute them from the
        transit parameters except where they are not otherwise available.
        Therefore, these values may be inconsistent with
        the mass derived from MSINI and the inclination because our MSINI
        values may have been computed from different spectroscopic orbital
        parameters or assuming a different stellar mass.
      </p>

      <h4>Uncertainties</h4>
      <p>
        We have recorded literature uncertainties in stellar masses, but when
        estimating uncertainties in msini and a we conservatively assume a
        minimum uncertainty in stellar mass of 5%.  We do this to account for
        likely systematic errors in model estimates of stellar masses (limits
        in their accuracy) for most planet-bearing stars.
      </p>

      <h4>FIRSTREF</h4>
      <p>
        The "first reference" field cites the first peer-reviewed
        journal article to contain a orbital solution and/or radial
        velocities documenting the existence of the planet.  In many cases
        this does not correspond to the first public announcement of a
        planet's existence, which may have been by press release, in
        conference proceedings, or by reference in another paper.  A list of
        planet discoveries, confirmations, and discovery claims is available
        at <a href="http://obswww.unige.ch/~naef/who_discovered_that_planet.html">http://obswww.unige.ch/~naef/who_discovered_that_planet.html</a>.
      </p>

      <h4>JHK Photometry</h4>
      <p>
        JHK photometry is from the <a href="http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/releases/allsky/">2MASS point source catalog</a> (Skrutskie et
        al. 2006).  In most cases
        coordinates come from the van Leeuwen (2008) rereduction of the
        Hipparcos data.  B and V magnitudes are heterogeneous, coming
        variously from the Hipparcos catalog, SIMBAD, and other literature
        sources, and so are not strictly all on the same scale.  Chromospheric
        activity measurements are from various sources, usually planet
        discovery papers plus references cited in Butler et al. (2006).
